Milo is a curious little hedgehog with a round belly, tiny glasses perched on his nose, and a backpack full of maps and snacks. His spiky fur is soft at the tips, and he always wears a red scarf that flutters when he runs.

Meet Captain Crumble, the superhero made entirely of biscuit crumbs and powered by imagination! He wears a buttery cape stitched from napkins, has jam-filled boots that squelch when he walks, and his eyes are chocolate chips that glow when danger is near. His crumbly body constantly sheds sprinkles, leaving trails of colour wherever he goes. With a whisk-shaped staff and a giggle that rumbles like a cookie tin, he saves the world one snack at a time!


Wobblewhisk is a squishy, jelly-bodied cat with translucent purple fur that jiggles like raspberry jelly when he moves. His ears are shaped like lemon slices, and his whiskers are made from glowing candy canes that wiggle when heâ€™s excited. He has big, bouncy blueberry eyes and wears a tiny top hat made of biscuit with a cherry on top. Wherever Wobblewhisk goes, he leaves behind a faint scent of bubblegum and a trail of sparkling sugar footprints.
