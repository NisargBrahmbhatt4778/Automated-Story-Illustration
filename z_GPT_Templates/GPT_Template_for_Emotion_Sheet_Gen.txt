Now create an emotion sheet for the character we've been working with.

You will receive a 1:1 aspect ratio (1024Ã—1024 px) grid image, divided into 9 equal squares (arranged in 3 columns and 3 rows).

Your task is to draw directly on top of this image, placing the character in each square and illustrating 9 distinct emotions.

Please return a square 1:1 aspect ratio image as output

Please follow these instructions:
 - Each square should show a different facial expression or emotional state (e.g., happy, sad, angry, scared, excited, calm, surprised, tired, confused).
 - Draw within the boundaries of each square, keeping each emotion framed clearly.
 - Maintain consistent proportions and style with the previous character and action sheets.
 - If needed, slightly zoom out to ensure the character fits entirely within each square without overlapping into neighbouring sections.
