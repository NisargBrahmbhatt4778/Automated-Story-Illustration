Milo is a curious little hedgehog with a round belly, tiny glasses perched on his nose, and a backpack full of maps and snacks. His spiky fur is soft at the tips, and he always wears a red scarf that flutters when he runs.

Meet Captain Crumble, the superhero made entirely of biscuit crumbs and powered by imagination! He wears a buttery cape stitched from napkins, has jam-filled boots that squelch when he walks, and his eyes are chocolate chips that glow when danger is near. His crumbly body constantly sheds sprinkles, leaving trails of colour wherever he goes. With a whisk-shaped staff and a giggle that rumbles like a cookie tin, he saves the world one snack at a time!

Wobblewhisk is a squishy, jelly-bodied cat with translucent purple fur that jiggles like raspberry jelly when he moves. His ears are shaped like lemon slices, and his whiskers are made from glowing candy canes that wiggle when he’s excited. He has big, bouncy blueberry eyes and wears a tiny top hat made of biscuit with a cherry on top. Wherever Wobblewhisk goes, he leaves behind a faint scent of bubblegum and a trail of sparkling sugar footprints.

A Robot warrior with glowing red eyes and long flowing silver hair. He wears heavy black armor and a crimson cape. His expression is fierce, and he stands tall, exuding power.

A floating jellyfish-cat with a shimmering, translucent body that glows in pastel hues—lavender, mint, and peach swirling like liquid rainbows. Instead of legs, it has long, wavy tendrils that drift beneath it like silk ribbons, and a wide, fluffy tail that sparkles with tiny star-shaped flecks. Its large, opal eyes shift colours with its mood, and two dainty, feathery wings sprout from behind its ears, fluttering gently even though it never touches the ground.
