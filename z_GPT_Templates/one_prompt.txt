Make me a combined character, action, and emotion sheet for the following description:
{Char_Description}

-----
The image needs to be appropriate for a children's storybook illustration.

I am providing you with a reference image that is divided into 3 rows and 7 columns, making 21 equally sized sections.

Please follow this layout precisely:
 - Top Row (Sections 1–7): Character Sheet — show the character in 7 different poses or outfits to give a sense of personality and design variations.
 - Middle Row (Sections 8–14): Action Sheet — illustrate the character performing 7 different actions that reflect their role, abilities, or personality.
 - Bottom Row (Sections 15–21): Emotion Sheet — depict 7 distinct facial expressions/emotions of the character (e.g., happy, sad, angry, surprised, scared, calm, excited).

Ensure that all drawings are done within the designated areas of the 7×3 grid I am providing, and that the character proportions remain consistent across all 21 segments.

The overall aspect ratio is 3:2 (landscape), and the visuals should fit neatly within each section of the grid.

You are drawing on top of the "grid_with_21_sections.png" file I will provide. Make sure the illustrations fit cleanly within each square and stay aligned to the borders.

⚠️ Do NOT draw or alter the black lines or grid layout. You must draw strictly inside the white boxes only. The lines are used in post-processing to automatically split the sheet, so they must remain unaltered and perfectly aligned.

Slightly zoom out if necessary to keep proportions balanced within the frame.

Keep the overall tone vibrant and storybook-friendly.
