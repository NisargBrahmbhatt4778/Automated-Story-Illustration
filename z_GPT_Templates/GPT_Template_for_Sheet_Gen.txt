Please generate a character sheet illustration based on the following character description:

{Char_Description}

This image must be styled as a children’s storybook illustration.
You will receive a blank template image (3:2 aspect ratio) that is divided into 6 equal rectangular sections, arranged in 3 columns and 2 rows.
Your task is to draw directly on top of this template, ensuring that each of the 6 segments is individually filled with a unique illustration of the character.
Use the 6 sections to show distinct poses or outfits to convey the character’s personality or design variations.
Please return a landscape 3:2 aspect ratio image as output
Make sure:
 - You draw inside the boundaries of each section, not across them.
 - The character proportions stay consistent between sections.
 - The drawing remains centred and well-framed within each segment.
