Create an emotion sheet showing this character expressing 9 different emotions:

CHARACTER: [Same as previously shown in character and action sheets]

⚠️ CRITICAL FRAMING: Show the ENTIRE head plus neck and shoulders with generous margins around the character in each square. Do not zoom in too close.

CRITICAL GRID REQUIREMENTS:
- You are provided with a template showing a 3×3 grid (9 equal squares total)
- Each square is a separate, isolated illustration area with visible boundaries
- DO NOT let any character parts extend beyond square boundaries
- ZOOM OUT to show full head, neck, and upper shoulders in each square
- Character's full head (including hair/hat/accessories) must be completely visible
- Maintain EXACT SAME zoom level and framing in all 9 squares

REQUIRED EMOTIONS (in order, left to right, top to bottom):
Cell 1 (Top Left): HAPPY - HUGE smile, joyful squinted eyes
Cell 2 (Top Center): SAD - Extreme frown, visible tears, droopy features
Cell 3 (Top Right): ANGRY - Deep scowl, furrowed brow, clenched teeth
Cell 4 (Middle Left): SURPRISED - Eyes wide as saucers, mouth in big O
Cell 5 (Middle Center): SCARED - Tiny pupils, trembling, mouth agape
Cell 6 (Middle Right): EXCITED - Massive grin, sparkly eyes, energetic
Cell 7 (Bottom Left): TIRED - Heavy eyelids, huge yawn, slumped
Cell 8 (Bottom Center): CONFUSED - Head tilt, one eyebrow up, puzzled
Cell 9 (Bottom Right): CALM - Peaceful smile, relaxed, serene

ALL emotions must be shown from the SAME viewing angle (front or 3/4 view).

STYLE SPECIFICATIONS:
- Maintain exact same children's storybook illustration style
- Use identical color palette and character design details
- EXAGGERATE expressions for clear emotional communication
- Show complete head plus neck and shoulders in EVERY square
- Frame character at MEDIUM DISTANCE - not close-up
- Simple backgrounds - can use subtle color variations per emotion
- Clear, bold outlines consistent with previous sheets
- Character should appear as if standing/sitting at same distance in all squares

CONSISTENCY RULES:
- Character features must match previous sheets exactly
- CRITICAL: Use same camera distance for all 9 squares (medium shot)
- Character's head should fill only 40-50% of square height
- Ensure 20-30% margin around character in every square
- All characters must face forward or slight 3/4 view (same angle)
- No cropping - show complete head including hair/accessories
- Imagine character is sitting for 9 portrait photos from same position

IMPORTANT: Generate a text-free image only - no words, letters, labels, or captions anywhere.

OUTPUT: A single square image (1:1 ratio) containing all 9 character emotions arranged in the 3×3 grid format shown in the template.
