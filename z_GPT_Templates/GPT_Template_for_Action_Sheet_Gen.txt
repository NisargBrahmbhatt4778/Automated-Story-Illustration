Now make me an action sheet for this character, showing 6 different actions they can do.
Please draw directly on top of the attached 3:2 template, which is divided into 6 equal sections (3 columns Ã— 2 rows).
Each section should show the character performing a unique action. Keep the drawings framed inside each box, and maintain the same style and proportions as in the character sheet.
Please return a landscape 3:2 aspect ratio image as output
