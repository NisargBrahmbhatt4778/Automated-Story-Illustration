Milo is a curious little hedgehog with a round belly, tiny glasses perched on his nose, and a backpack full of maps and snacks. His spiky fur is soft at the tips, and he always wears a red scarf that flutters when he runs.

Wobblewhisk is a squishy, jelly-bodied cat with translucent purple fur that jiggles like raspberry jelly when he moves. His ears are shaped like lemon slices, and his whiskers are made from glowing candy canes that wiggle when he’s excited. He has big, bouncy blueberry eyes and wears a tiny top hat made of biscuit with a cherry on top. Wherever Wobblewhisk goes, he leaves behind a faint scent of bubblegum and a trail of sparkling sugar footprints.

A Robot warrior with glowing red eyes and long flowing silver hair. He wears heavy black armor and a crimson cape. His expression is fierce, and he stands tall, exuding power.

Pompomble is a fluffy, round creature shaped like a giant dandelion puff, with soft fuzz that glitters in rainbow colours. He has jellybean-shaped feet that squish when he walks and long, stretchy arms like twisted candy ropes ending in marshmallowy mittens. A single glowing gumdrop eye sits in the centre of his face, topped by leafy green eyebrows that wiggle with every move. On his head spins a colourful pinwheel hat, and from behind trails a curly soda-straw tail striped in orange and pink.

Bibbleboo is a round, chubby creature with skin that looks like smooth, swirly bubblegum in shades of teal and lavender. His ears are shaped like upside-down teacups, and his nose is a tiny, glowing star that twinkles when he blinks. He has short, wobbly legs that end in donut-shaped feet, and his arms are covered in soft feathers that shimmer like soap bubbles. Sprouting from his back are three fluffy balloons that float gently above him, keeping him light on his toes.




A floating jellyfish-cat with a shimmering, translucent body that glows in pastel hues—lavender, mint, and peach swirling like liquid rainbows. Instead of legs, it has long, wavy tendrils that drift beneath it like silk ribbons, and a wide, fluffy tail that sparkles with tiny star-shaped flecks. Its large, opal eyes shift colours with its mood, and two dainty, feathery wings sprout from behind its ears, fluttering gently even though it never touches the ground.

Meet Captain Crumble, the superhero made entirely of biscuit crumbs and powered by imagination! He wears a buttery cape stitched from napkins, has jam-filled boots that squelch when he walks, and his eyes are chocolate chips that glow when danger is near. His crumbly body constantly sheds sprinkles, leaving trails of colour wherever he goes. With a whisk-shaped staff and a giggle that rumbles like a cookie tin, he saves the world one snack at a time!
