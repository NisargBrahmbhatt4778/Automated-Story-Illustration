Create a character reference sheet following these EXACT specifications:

CHARACTER: {Char_Description}

CRITICAL GRID REQUIREMENTS:
- You are provided with a template showing a 3Ã—2 grid (3 columns, 2 rows = 6 cells total)
- Each cell is a separate, isolated illustration area with visible boundaries
- DO NOT let any character parts extend beyond cell boundaries
- Treat each cell as its own mini-canvas with clear margins around the character

REQUIRED POSES (in order, left to right, top to bottom):
Cell 1 (Top Left): Front view - character standing straight, arms at sides
Cell 2 (Top Middle): 3/4 view - character turned 45 degrees, one hand on hip  
Cell 3 (Top Right): Side profile - full left or right side view
Cell 4 (Bottom Left): Back view - showing character from behind
Cell 5 (Bottom Middle): Sitting pose - character seated naturally
Cell 6 (Bottom Right): Action pose - character in motion (running, jumping, or gesturing)

STYLE SPECIFICATIONS:
- Children's storybook illustration style with soft, rounded edges
- Consistent color palette across all 6 cells
- Simple, clean backgrounds (can be different subtle colors per cell)
- Clear, bold outlines to define the character
- Maintain exact same character height relative to cell size in all panels

CONSISTENCY RULES:
- Character must be the EXACT same size in each cell (adjust pose, not scale)
- Keep all clothing, colors, and design details identical across cells
- Center each character within their respective cell
- Leave breathing room (at least 10% margin) around character in each cell

OUTPUT: A single landscape image (3:2 ratio) containing all 6 character poses arranged in the grid format shown in the template.
