Create an action sheet showing this character performing 6 different activities appropriate to their nature:

CHARACTER: [Same as previously shown]

CRITICAL GRID REQUIREMENTS:
- You are provided with a template showing a 3Ã—2 grid (3 columns, 2 rows = 6 cells total)
- Each cell is a separate, isolated illustration area with visible boundaries
- DO NOT let any character parts or action effects extend beyond cell boundaries
- Treat each cell as its own mini-canvas with clear margins around the action

REQUIRED ACTION CATEGORIES (in order, left to right, top to bottom):
Cell 1: MOVEMENT - How this character travels (run/fly/swim/slither/float/roll)
Cell 2: ATHLETIC - This character's version of jumping or dynamic movement
Cell 3: INTERACTION - Character using a tool/object/ability unique to them
Cell 4: EXPRESSION - Character celebrating or showing joy in their own way
Cell 5: RESTING - Character in their natural calm or resting position
Cell 6: COMMUNICATION - Character greeting or signaling in character-appropriate way

IMPORTANT: Choose specific actions that make sense for THIS character's:
- Physical form (legs/wings/fins/wheels/etc.)
- Abilities (magic/strength/technology/etc.)
- Personality and nature
- Size and proportions

STYLE SPECIFICATIONS:
- Maintain exact same children's storybook illustration style from character sheet
- Use identical color palette and character design
- Add simple motion lines or effects where appropriate (within cell bounds)
- Keep backgrounds minimal - just hints of ground/context
- Clear, bold outlines consistent with previous sheet
- Actions should feel natural and authentic to THIS character's nature

CONSISTENCY RULES:
- Character size must match the scale used in the character sheet
- Maintain all design details (clothing, colors, features) exactly
- Center each action within its respective cell
- Leave breathing room (at least 10% margin) around character in each cell
- Show full body in each action (no cropping)

IMPORTANT: Generate a text-free image only - no words, letters, labels, or captions anywhere.

OUTPUT: A single landscape image (3:2 ratio) containing all 6 character actions arranged in the grid format shown in the template.
